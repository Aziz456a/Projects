# Projects

First project : Well it is not technically my first but its the first i decide to put here in github.
                This project was part of my school assignement and its about building an AI model to classify spam messages.
                The data is public and can be accessed from Kaggle.

You can access the dataset for the project using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/data.
I hope this work would be helpful.



Second project : Well this is actually my end of studies project.My project mainly focused on integrating Generative IA using RAG with
                 microsoft sentinel in order to enhance automation. I was able to add an extra feature after that by integrating Notebooks 
                 execution automation pipeline using for the 2 features implementation python code. more precisely the orchestration component
                 written in python and deployed to Azure is what is going to be shared in here alongsidethe sample jupyter Notebook used for
                 testing purposes of the automation pipeline. called Anomaly_Detection.

Note : Anomaly_Detection notebook is forked from Azure sentinel Github repo and modified. 



Third project : Its a small project realised in my freetime and its mostly inspired from FreecodeCamp youtube channel about making chrome extensions.
                Its basicly Rock-paper-scisor game using javascript.
